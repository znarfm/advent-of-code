# Advent of Code

[Website](https://adventofcode.com/)

Just a compilation of my solutions for the problem sets each day.
I'll be also adding short comments about my experience, just because.

## 2023

Using Python because me == nub.

- [Day 1](/2023/day-1/) - hard pset, but a good start
- [Day 2](/2023/day-2/) - easier than day 1?
- [Day 3](/2023/day-3/) - much harder than day 1 and 2 lmao
